Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.














X = int(input()) + 1;
Y = int(input()) + 1;
Z = int(input()) + 1;
N = int(input());
lst = [];
for x in range(0,X):
    for y in range(0,Y):
        for z in range(0, Z): 
            if (x + y + z) != N: 
                lst.append([x,y,z]);

print(lst);
